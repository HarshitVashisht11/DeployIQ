# DeployIQ
DeployIQ is a application that simplifies deploying open-source LLMs (like Llama 3, Mistral, and Falcon) on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), bare-metal servers, or local Docker environments, with automated GPU provisioning, scaling, and secure API exposure, while integrating monitoring and logging for seamless inference management.
